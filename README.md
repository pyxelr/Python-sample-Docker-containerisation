# Python/Django sample Docker containerisation

This repository contains the code produced using the recent VS Code documentation: [**Python in a container**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-python).

To run this project, you will need:
* Docker Desktop - for example, the free [Docker Community Edition (CE) for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).

After a successful run, the Django app should launch in a browser with a randomly mapped port.
